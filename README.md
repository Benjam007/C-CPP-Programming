<h1>Introduction C++</h1>

<p><b>What is C++ Programming Language ?</b>

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

 C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
 </p>

<h2> C++ compiler /IDE </h2>

<p>
To start using C++, you need two things:

- A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
- A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.

Popular IDE's include:
 Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.
 These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.

I will be using Code::Blocks in this Project, which I believe is a good place to start.

You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. 

Download the `mingw-setup.exe file`, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
</p>

<h4> Quick Start :</h4>

<p>

- Let's create our first C++ file.
- Open **Codeblocks** and go to File > New > Empty File.
- Write the following C++ code and save the file as **myfirstprogram.cpp** (File > Save File as):


```
// myfirstprogram.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```


- In Codeblocks, it should look like this:

- Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. 
- **Congratulations!** You have now written and executed your first C++ program.
